## How it works
This project implements a very minimal perceptron-based branch predictor. Using basic SPI, it reads in the lower part of the address of a branch instruction and its ground truth branch direction (taken or not taken).
Due to constraints on the memory architecture (namely, 1 byte read per cycle), the prediciton is not single-cycle.

The branch predictor is based on this paper: [Dynamic Branch Prediction with Perceptrons](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/papers/hpca01.pdf).

This project uses latch-based memory from Michael Dell, available at: [tt06-memory](https://github.com/MichaelBell/tt06-memory)

It's best to run this project in its Docker container.

The `func_sim` directory contains a C++ functional simulation of the infrastructure. It parses a log file of a simulated execution of a RISC-V reference program and predicts the branch direction on each branch instruction.
From the `func_sim` directory:
-Compile the reference: `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -O0 start.S reference.c -o reference -march=rv32i_zicsr_zifencei -T link.ld -nostartfiles -nostdlib`
-Disassemble reference: `riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -d reference > reference_dis.txt` (for info only)
-Run Spike on reference: `spike --log=spike_log.txt --log-commits --isa=rv32i_zicsr_zifencei --priv=m -m128 reference` (to generate execution log)
-Make Makefile: `cmake CMakeLists.txt`
-Compile functional simulation: `make`
-Run: `./build/func_sim ./spike_log.txt`

The `tests` directory includes all CocoTB test for this design.
Run them with `make`.

## How to test
The branch predictor reads the lowest 8b of a 32b RISC-V address on pins `inst_addr`, the branch direction on pin uio[1] and a pulse notifying that new data is available on pin `new_data_avail`.
Once the prediction is ready, it pulses pin `pred_ready`, pushes the prediction on pin `prediction`. Once training is complete, it pulses pin `training_done`.

Notes:
- After rst_n goes back high, you must wait for `mem_reset_done` to pulse. This is because the branch predictor resets its own memory. If new data comes in while it is resetting its memory, an inference will not be started.
- If no training is required this round, `training_done` pulses at the same time as `pred_ready`.
- If new data is sent while the predictor is training, it will be ignored and a new inference will not be started.

To generate the instructions to use, you can either:
1) Parse `func_sim/spike_log.txt` with is a log of all instructions ran for the program `func_sim/reference.c` simulated on RISC-V rv32i_zicsr_zifencei. See `func_sim/src/func_sim.cpp` to see how that's done.
2) Generate a new log for a program of your choice. For this, you'll need to build the Docker. Word of caution: The Dockert takes >30 min top build and weighs >24GB.
   1) From root, run: `docker build -t tt_brand_predictor .`
   2) Once complete, run: ``docker run -it -v `pwd`:/tmp tt_brand_predictor``
   3) Move to `func_sim`: `cd func_sim`
   4) Compile `reference.c`: `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -O0 start.S reference.c -o reference -march=rv32i_zicsr_zifencei -T link.ld -nostartfiles -nostdlib`
   5) Optionally, view the disassembly with: `riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -d reference > reference_dis.txt`
   6) Generate execution log with Spike: `spike --log=spike_log.txt --log-commits --isa=rv32i_zicsr_zifencei --priv=m -m128 reference`
3) Running `func_sim` outputs a list of all branch instruction and the state of important registers in the branch predictor. You can use that to check if the predicted branch outcome is correct: `./build/func_sim ./spike_log.txt`
